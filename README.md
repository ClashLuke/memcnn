# MemCNN 
a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) Framework for Developing Memory Efficient Deep Invertible Networks

## Licencing

The involved parties have not all given formal consent on the licencing form of the project, hence the code can't be put publicly available yet. However, it is the intention of the authors to make the framework publicly available in the future and agreement is expected to be reached in one or two weeks time. Please contact the main author at `sil.vandeleemput[AT]radboudumc.nl` for further information or reviewing purposes.
